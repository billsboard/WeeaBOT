# WeeaBOT

This bot is a rewrite of [Lyndon Ho's](https://github.com/Lydxn "Lyndon's Github Repository") WeeaBOT. His bot was originally written in Python, but he could no longer host the bot
to keep uptime. As a result, I have taken over, and recoded the bot using Java.

Although the language used to program the bot has changed, all the features existing from be the other bot have been preserved.
